    "# Web Map Services\n",
    "\n",
    "Web map services (WMS) provide small, pre-rendered image tiles that collectively form a larger map when displayed in a grid-like pattern. Each tile represents a specific geographic area and zoom level, allowing users to view maps at different scales and locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tile Specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "Various specifications govern the functionality of web map services, including TMS (Tile Map Service), WMTS (Web Map Tile Service), and XYZ. These specifications define how the tiles are organized, accessed, and displayed within a web mapping context.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is not necessary to delve into the technical details of these underlying specifications in order to benefit from web map services. The implementation takes care of these intricacies behind the scenes, allowing users to seamlessly utilize the service without requiring in-depth knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, it is useful to have an understanding of the format that each specification follows. Here are examples of URL patterns associated with each specification:\n",
    "\n",
    "TMS (Tile Map Service): http://example.com/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\n",
    "WMTS (Web Map Tile Service): http://example.com/wmts/{Layer}/{TileMatrixSet}/{TileMatrix}/{TileRow}/{TileCol}.png\n",
    "XYZ: http://example.com/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\n",
    "\n",
    "These URLs represent the structure for accessing individual map tiles based on their zoom level (z), column (x), and row (y) coordinates, and sometimes, as you'll see later, it's based on the bounds `{XMIN},{XMAX},{YMIN},{YMAX}`. Other specifications exist as well, such as Quadkey used by Bing Maps and GeoPackage for storing tiles in a single file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Online WMS Viewers\n",
    "\n",
    "Online WMS viewers provide a user-friendly interface for accessing and visualizing geospatial data through web map services. They offer a convenient way to explore and interact with various layers of information, ranging from weather data to satellite imagery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of online WMS viewers:\n",
    "\n",
    "NOAA Weather Viewer (https://viewer.weather.noaa.gov/): This viewer, provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), allows users to access and visualize real-time weather information, including radar data, forecasts, and satellite imagery. It offers an intuitive interface for exploring weather conditions and monitoring meteorological phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "National Map Viewer (https://apps.nationalmap.gov/viewer/): The National Map Viewer, developed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), provides access to a wide range of geospatial data, including topographic maps, aerial imagery, and elevation data. Users can explore and overlay different datasets, enabling them to analyze and visualize various geographic features.\n",
    "\n",
    "NASA Worldview (https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/): NASA Worldview is a powerful online WMS viewer that offers access to a vast collection of satellite imagery and Earth observation data. Users can view imagery captured by different satellite missions and explore global environmental changes over time. The viewer supports advanced visualization and analysis tools, allowing users to study phenomena such as atmospheric conditions, land cover changes, and natural disasters.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are existing online WMS viewers that provide access to a wide range of geospatial data, **the true power of web map services (WMS) lies in the ability to overlay them with your own data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore how to do this below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",

    "## Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s first import a few packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "GeoViews is a Python library that facilitates the integration of WMS and other geospatial data sources with your own datasets. It provides a high-level interface for working with geographic data and simplifies the process of creating interactive visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "CartoPy is a Python library that specializes in handling map projections and geospatial data visualization. It provides a wide range of tools and functionalities to work with geospatial datasets, making it easier to create maps with different projections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel is a Python library that offers a set of flexible and powerful tools for creating interactive dashboards and apps. It allows you to build custom user interfaces with interactive controls, widgets, and layout components, enabling rich interactivity for your visualizations and data analysis workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requests is a popular Python library for making HTTP requests. It simplifies sending HTTP requests to web servers and handling the responses. In the context of geospatial data visualization, requests can be used to retrieve data from web services, such as WMS endpoints, to integrate external data sources into your visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "OWSLib is a Python library designed for client-side programming using the interface standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) web services and their associated content models. Specifically, in this scenario, OWSLib will be utilized solely for the purpose of constructing URLs for WMS.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next line, `gv.extension(\"bokeh\")`, enables the Bokeh (interactive) plotting backend for GeoViews. GeoViews supports multiple plotting backends, such as Bokeh and Matplotlib, which allow you to choose the one that best suits your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, `pn.extension()` initializes the panel library and sets up the necessary environment for creating interactive panels and dashboards. You may specify configurations like `sizing_mode=\"stretch_width\"` within `pn.extension()`."

    "## Using Built-in Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how to use GeoViews to access built-in WMS tile sources effortlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "By activating the \"pan\" and \"wheel_zoom\" tools, users gain interactive control over the map. They can easily navigate the map by dragging, exploring different areas, and experiencing a sense of flexibility and control.\n",
    "\n",
    "To experience the capabilities of WMS and GeoViews, try zooming in on the map. As you zoom in, you will notice that more details and finer features become visible, providing a richer and more detailed representation of the geographic data.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Overlaying Custom Data\n",
    "\n",
    "By integrating WMS layers with your own data, you can unlock the potential of geospatial information and create maps that communicate intricate spatial relationships, highlight patterns and trends, and offer valuable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate this with an example. In isolation, the coordinates (40.1N, -88.26W) may not hold much significance. However, when overlaying the WMS tiles and zooming in, you might discover that these coordinates correspond to the location of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the author's alma mater. This simple overlay demonstrates how WMS layers can provide context and meaningful information to otherwise isolated data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `crs` and `projection` were specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `crs=ccrs.PlateCarree()` argument specifies that the data coordinates are **from** the Plate Carree coordinate reference system, which is commonly used for latitude and longitude values.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the `projection` parameter determines what the data should be transformed **to** before being displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**At the time of writing, GeoViews only supports overlaying data with tile sources when the map's projection is set to `ccrs.GOOGLE_MERCATOR`.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the `global_extent=True` option ensures that the map displays the entire world."

    "## Understanding the URL Template\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided URL template is used to construct a request for a specific map image using WMS protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the components of the URL to understand its functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `https://mapservices.weather.noaa.gov:443/eventdriven/services/`\n",
    "   This is the base URL for the NOAA weather map services. It specifies the server address and port.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `radar/radar_base_reflectivity_time/ImageServer/WMSServer?`\n",
    "   This part of the URL specifies the specific service and resource being accessed. In this case, it indicates the radar_base_reflectivity_time image service within the radar category.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `service=WMS&version=1.1.1&request=GetMap`\n",
    "   These parameters define the service type (WMS) and the version of the WMS protocol being used (1.1.1). It also specifies that the request is to retrieve a map image (GetMap).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `layers=0`\n",
    "   This parameter indicates the layer or layers from which the map image should be retrieved. In this case, it specifies layer 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `styles=default`\n",
    "   This parameter specifies the style to be applied to the map image. Here, it is set to the default style.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `width=256&height=256`\n",
    "   These parameters define the width and height (in pixels) of the requested map image.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `srs=EPSG%3A3857`\n",
    "   This parameter specifies the spatial reference system (SRS) for the map image. In this case, it uses the EPSG:3857 coordinate reference system.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `bbox={XMIN}%2C{YMIN}%2C{XMAX}%2C{YMAX}`\n",
    "   This parameter specifies the bounding box for the requested map image. The values {XMIN}, {YMIN}, {XMAX}, and {YMAX} will be replaced with actual coordinate values. The values provided within the curly braces are percent-encoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `format=image%2Fpng&transparent=TRUE`\n",
    "   These parameters define the desired image format (PNG) and specify that the image should have a transparent background.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.  `exceptions=application%2Fvnd.ogc.se_xml&bgcolor=0xFFFFFF`\n",
    "    These parameters define how exceptions should be reported (in XML format) and set the background color for the map image to white (#FFFFFF).\n",

    "You might also be wondering what those percent-encoded characters, like `%2C`, mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Percent-encoding is a mechanism used to represent special and reserved characters in URLs by replacing them with a \"%\" symbol followed by their hexadecimal representation. It ensures safe transmission and proper interpretation of URLs containing characters with special meanings or non-ASCII characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "To de-mystify the template URL a step further, we can simply use `requests.utils.unquote` and see:\n",
