    "Let’s first import a few packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "HoloViews and GeoViews is a Python library that facilitates the integration of WMS and other geospatial data sources with your own datasets. It provides a high-level interface for working with geographic data and simplifies the process of creating interactive visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It offers versatile data structures, such as Series and DataFrame, for working with structured data. However, here, we will only be using it to generate date time ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel is a Python library that offers a set of flexible and powerful tools for creating interactive dashboards and apps. It allows you to build custom user interfaces with interactive controls, widgets, and layout components, enabling rich interactivity for your visualizations and data analysis workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "OWSLib is a Python library designed for client-side programming using the interface standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) web services and their associated content models. Specifically, in this scenario, OWSLib will be utilized solely for the purpose of constructing URLs for WMS.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next line, `hv.extension(\"bokeh\")`, enables the Bokeh (interactive) plotting backend for GeoViews. GeoViews supports multiple plotting backends, such as Bokeh and Matplotlib, which allow you to choose the one that best suits your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, `pn.extension()` initializes the panel library and sets up the necessary environment for creating interactive panels and dashboards. You may specify configurations like `sizing_mode=\"stretch_width\"` within `pn.extension()`."

    "\n",
    "Accessing NASA's GIBS (Global Imagery Browse Services) is well-documented, and you can find the documentation [here](https://nasa-gibs.github.io/gibs-api-docs/access-basics/).\n",
    "\n",
    "To access GIBS through the WMS (Web Map Service) endpoints, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find the WMS service endpoints by referring to the [service endpoints section](https://nasa-gibs.github.io/gibs-api-docs/access-basics/#service-endpoints_1) of the documentation. Look for the row that corresponds to the EPSG:3857 projection, as GeoViews currently supports that projection for tile services.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Once you have identified the WMS service endpoint, copy one of the versions' [GetCapabilities URLs](https://gibs.earthdata.nasa.gov/wms/epsg3857/best/wms.cgi?SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetCapabilities&VERSION=1.3.0). This URL provides information about the available layers and operations supported by the WMS service.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Pass the GetCapabilities URL to the `WebMapService` class, which is a part of the `OWSLib` library. This class allows you to interact with the WMS service and retrieve the desired data.\n",

    "Here are a few ideas to try:\n",
    "- Implementing a search bar feature to easily navigate through the available layers.\n",
    "- Overlaying satellite fire detection layers with other data sets, such as air quality measurements, to gain deeper insights.\n",
    "- Examining the correlation between night lights and population density to uncover interesting patterns and trends.\n",
    "- Tracking changes in land types over the years to observe the evolving landscape.\n",
    "- By incorporating these ideas, the explorer can offer a more comprehensive and dynamic user experience.\n",
    "- Visualizing climate data: Integrate climate data layers such as temperature, precipitation, or wind patterns to understand the relationship between climate and various geographical features.\n",
    "- Analyzing vegetation indices: Incorporate vegetation indices like NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) to assess vegetation health and identify areas with dense vegetation or potential vegetation changes.\n",
    "- Mapping infrastructure and urban development: Overlay infrastructure data, such as roads, buildings, and urban areas, to analyze the impact of urbanization on the surrounding environment and land use patterns.\n",
    "- Exploring natural disasters: Incorporate real-time or historical data on natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods, to study their impact on the affected regions and aid in disaster management and response efforts.\n",
    "- Monitoring water resources: Utilize data on water bodies, water availability, and water quality to assess water resources, identify areas of concern, and track changes over time.\n",
    "- Investigating demographic patterns: Overlay demographic data, such as population density, age groups, or socioeconomic indicators, to study demographic patterns and their spatial relationships with other layers.\n",
    "- Tracking wildlife habitats: Integrate data on wildlife habitats, migration patterns, or conservation areas to gain insights into ecological dynamics and support biodiversity conservation efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, it's important to note that the functionality of this explorer is not restricted to geographic maps alone. It has the flexibility to incorporate a combination of charts and maps, offering a more diverse and comprehensive data visualization experience.\n",
