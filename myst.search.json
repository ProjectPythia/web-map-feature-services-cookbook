This streamlines the data acquisition process and enables users to focus on their analysis tasks rather than data processing.\n\nPre-processed Data: Web map services provide access to a wide range of pre-processed geospatial data layers. This eliminates the need for users to perform data processing tasks themselves, saving time and effort.\n\nReady-to-Use Tiles: Users can simply fetch the tiles from the web map services and use them as a reference or overlay in their analysis. This makes it convenient to integrate the data into their own applications without the need to handle complex data processing workflows.\n\nProduction-Level Data: Web map services are often deployed at production level, ensuring that the data is up-to-date and near real-time. This is particularly advantageous for applications that require the latest information, such as weather monitoring or real-time asset tracking.","type":"content","url":"/#motivation","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Web Map / Feature Services Cookbook","lvl2":"Authors"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/#authors","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Web Map / Feature Services Cookbook","lvl2":"Authors"},"content":"Andrew Huang","type":"content","url":"/#authors","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Web Map / Feature Services Cookbook","lvl3":"Contributors","lvl2":"Authors"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/#contributors","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Web Map / Feature Services Cookbook","lvl3":"Contributors","lvl2":"Authors"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/#contributors","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Web Map / Feature Services Cookbook","lvl2":"Structure"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/#structure","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Web Map / Feature Services Cookbook","lvl2":"Structure"},"content":"This cookbook is broken up into two main sections - “Foundations” and “Example Workflows.”","type":"content","url":"/#structure","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Web Map / Feature Services Cookbook","lvl3":"Foundations","lvl2":"Structure"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/#foundations","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Web Map / Feature Services Cookbook","lvl3":"Foundations","lvl2":"Structure"},"content":"The foundational content includes:\n\nWeb Map Services\n\nWeb Feature Services","type":"content","url":"/#foundations","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Web Map / Feature Services Cookbook","lvl3":"Example Workflows","lvl2":"Structure"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/#example-workflows","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Web Map / Feature Services Cookbook","lvl3":"Example Workflows","lvl2":"Structure"},"content":"Example workflows include:\n\nNASA Earthdata GIBS Explorer","type":"content","url":"/#example-workflows","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Web Map / Feature Services Cookbook","lvl3":"Running on Binder","lvl2":"Structure"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/#running-on-binder","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Web Map / Feature Services Cookbook","lvl3":"Running on Binder","lvl2":"Structure"},"content":"The simplest way to interact with a Jupyter Notebook is through\n\n\nBinder, which enables the execution of a\n\n\nJupyter Book in the cloud.

However, when overlaying the WMS tiles and zooming in, you might discover that these coordinates correspond to the location of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the author’s alma mater.
